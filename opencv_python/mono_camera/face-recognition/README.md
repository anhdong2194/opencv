# Face Recognition 
Repository for face recognition related scripts.

For work I got involved in a project that dealt with face recognition. For this project, we created a robot based on a Lego Mindstorms EV3 unit that can navigate autonomously through a world and which could find persons based on face recogntion.

In this repository I will publish scripts related to this project.

More details about this project can be found in the following posts on my blog:
